# go-whosonfirst-api-batch

Go package for working with batch [Who's On First API](https://mapzen.com/documentation/places/) requests.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.7 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.9](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

Too soon. Move along.
